**Save your Emails and Passwords *(encrypted)* on a txt file and decrypt passwords when needed**


Made this program so that it'll be easier for me to remember the passwords by saving the passwords with some security
if another user opens the txt file.


* **Used datastructure Dictionary<TKey, TValue>** to save every alphabetical and numeric character's key. 

* **Used LINQ** to search in dictionary for decrypting or encrypting 

**Default txt file directory is " D:/ "** , can be changed in Program.cs class

**Update :**
* User can now set 3 digit passcode to access decrypter.
